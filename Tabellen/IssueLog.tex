        4 & The 9th Assigned Activity found in block Non-Engineering Implementation Tasks, found in RCW CMII ECA-NE Workflow, should be renamed to "Master Planner Changes"  & Resolved &  \\ \hline
        5 & I was unable to find a role name containing "BIM", or "Building" or "Content". Thus am not able to add a role or person for BIM Content to the Team Template & To Discuss & According to specification the role for BIM content is Drawings Engineer

        There is one role for two departments. We should add another role (say "BIM Engineer") so all will be clear. Fabian can check if "similar" role already exists. \\ \hline
        6 & On step 1 of the change process, I see 9 Radio button selections.  I expected to see 11 Radio buttons & Resolved & FHD only has 9 radio button selections as per specification (the 2 other attributes are hidden via the xml files). Only for Lowara, Lowara Hungary and Vogel the 2 extra radio button selections are visible. \\ \hline
        7 & On step 1 of the change process, only Safety Agency Approvals was set to a default of Yes, probably because it was deemed to have such a high level of importance in the past.  But the logic implies that other buttons are not so important.  Do we want to leave or fix this default? & To Discuss & This behaviour was taken over from the previous version of the workflow. Can be changed if neccessary.

        Business to provide feedback which are the good defaults. Probably all "No". \\ \hline
        9 & On TRN, (Engr ECA), Review Eng Implementation Tasks, 11 Roles are seen, but only 8 had a person assigned; No person assigned for Hydraulic designer, Motor designer, or Part Specifcation Engineer, despite the fact that the Team Template was fully populated & To Discuss & The users from the Team Template were automatically removed by the workflow, due to the radio button selection

        Would be better to see "full" version of workflow, i.e. with all roles. Need  instructions how to flavorize the workflows. Once the FHD workflow is fully validated, Xylem will use Lowara as a "flavorization pilot" \\ \hline
