        4 & The 9th Assigned Activity found in block Non-Engineering Implementation Tasks, found in RCW CMII ECA-NE Workflow, should be renamed to "Master Planner Changes"  & Resolved &  \\ \hline
        5 & I was unable to find a role name containing "BIM", or "Building" or "Content". Thus am not able to add a role or person for BIM Content to the Team Template & To Discuss & According to specification the role for BIM content is Drawings Engineer

        There is one role for two departments. We should add another role (say "BIM Engineer") so all will be clear. Fabian can check if "similar" role already exists. \\ \hline
        6 & On step 1 of the change process, I see 9 Radio button selections.  I expected to see 11 Radio buttons & Resolved & FHD only has 9 radio button selections as per specification (the 2 other attributes are hidden via the xml files). Only for Lowara, Lowara Hungary and Vogel the 2 extra radio button selections are visible. \\ \hline
